And now for something completely different... I live in New York, and
there is this fantastic restaurant in the East Village called Caracas
Arepa Bar. While the Arepas there are great, the best part by far is
this incredible sauce they have that everyone slathers all over
everything. Some time ago, I found a recipe for something very similar
over at\ `CheekyStitch`_, but that post seems to be down. Thankfully,
Google Cache came to the rescue, and I was able to grab the recipe to
archive here.

**Mango Arepa Sauce**, originally from `CheekyStitch`_

-  1/2 cup cilantro
-  1/2 cup parsley
-  1 cup (or to taste) extra virgin olive oil
-  1/2 cup vinegar
-  1 1/2 cup of yellow peppers
-  1/2 cup of mango
-  4Â  cloves garlic
-  1/2 teaspoon pepper
-  2 teaspoons cumin
-  1 teaspoon mayo
-  1 tablespoons oregano
-  salt to taste

Put all ingredients but olive oil in blender. Once pureed, gradually mix
in olive oil until at desired consistency.
