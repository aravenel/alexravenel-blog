My name is Alex Ravenel, and I have been tinkering with technology since
I broke my parent's brand new 386 while playing hangman on it in the
basement at the age of four. I'm starting this blog to serve mostly as a
reference for myself as I tinker with various different things--linux,
programming, vim, xbmc, whatever. Personal blogs have always been one of
the greatest references available to solving the myriad of little issues
one inevitably runs into when tinkering, and I'd like to leave a record
of the issues that I faced that I didn't find much existing information
on. At the least, this will be a reference for me if I ever face the
issue again and can't remember how I resolved it. At best, I might help
someone else who is facing the same issue.

I probably won't post here regularly or even often--but I do hope that
someone can find this useful.
