I stream Netflix to an HTPC I have setup. Depending on what I am
watching, I sometimes want to manually tweak the quality of the
streaming beyond Netflix's automatic detection--for example, some videos
playing in full HD overwhelm the machine's ability to decode the video,
causing stuttering. Alternatively, I may want to force HD for some
videos.

There is a built-in but not easy to find way to do this. While watching
the video (not fullscreen), press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+s. This will bring up
an option to manually set the bitrate. Note that doing this will turn
off Netflix's automatic detection for the current video, so for example
if your network connection slows down, you may see stuttering and/or
buffering.
