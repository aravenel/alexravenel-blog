using Virtualenv. If you are doing this under Windows, you may have had
any number of problems (see &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.alexravenel.com/?p=82"&gt;previous rant&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most recent issue came with trying to install Celery inside a
virtualenv. My installation was failing when compiling the Billiard
dependency with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;C:\MinGW\bin\gcc.exe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-shared&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\temp.win32-2.7\Release\modules\_billiard\multiprocessing.o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\temp.win32-2.7\Re&lt;/span&gt; lease\modules\_billiard\semaphore.o &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\temp.win32-2.7\Release\modules\_billiard\pipe_connection.o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\temp.win32-2.&lt;/span&gt; 7\Release\modules\_billiard\socket_connection.o &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\temp.win32-2.7\Release\modules\_billiard\win32_functions.o&lt;/span&gt; build\t &lt;span class="pre"&gt;emp.win32-2.7\Release\modules\_billiard\_billiard.def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-LC:\Users\aravenel\code\WeeklyMenus\venv\libs&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-LC:\Users\aravenel&lt;/span&gt; \code\WeeklyMenus\venv\PCbuild &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-lws2_32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-lpython27&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-lmsvcr90&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="pre"&gt;build\lib.win32-2.7\_billiard.pyd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;c:/mingw/bin/../lib/gcc/mingw32/4.6.2/../../../../mingw32/bin/ld.exe:
cannot find -lpython27&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;collect2: ld returned 1 exit status&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This as it turns out is an issue with the Virtualenv not correctly
knowing the location of the Python libraries upon which it depends
(notably libpython27.a). To fix this, simply edit the activate.bat
script in your venv/Scripts folder to add the following line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;set &lt;span class="pre"&gt;LIBRARY_PATH=c:\python27\libs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voila. No more compiler errors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Python. I got my start writing it at work to automate simple but
tedious tasks (&amp;quot;rename these 4,000 files according to their author and
timestamp&amp;quot;), but quickly started tinkering with it for all sorts of
other uses. One of the things I love about it most is that it is
(usually) clean, clear, and concise. You know exactly what the code is
doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, writing Python code in Windows is a colossal PITA. Whereas in
Linux (and presumably Mac) the Python binaries and libraries are a
simple package manager call away, in Windows, there is no shortage of
the hoops you have to jump through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, I was trying to install the most recent version of Celery
on Windows 7 using pip. This however failed with cryptic
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;Unable to find vcvarsall.bat&lt;/tt&gt; errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, this was related to the Python distutils being unable to find
a compiler. To resolve this, do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download and install the MinGW compiler from&amp;nbsp;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.mingw.org/"&gt;http://www.mingw.org/&lt;/a&gt;.
Make sure to select the c and c++ compilers when installing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add&amp;nbsp;C:\MinGW\bin (or wherever you installed MinGW) to the system
path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open (create if it doesn't exist) the
file&amp;nbsp;PYTHONPATH\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg (for me, this was
in&amp;nbsp;C:\Python27\Lib\distutils).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add the below lines to the file:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;[build]&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="line-block"&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;compiler=mingw32&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="line"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This resolved the first error. However, that didn't fix everything--now
I was getting
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;gcc: error: unrecognized command line option &lt;span class="pre"&gt;'-mno-cygwin'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; errors.
Turns out that this is related to a deprecated gcc flag that the version
of distutils included in my version of Python (2.7.2) was using.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fix this, I went into C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.py and
found all places where it was calling gcc with this deprecated flag.
There was a cluster of them around line 322. I then removed the
-mno-cygwin flag from these gcc calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After this, everything installed successfully. What a pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, and once it's running, you can't run &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;celeryd&lt;/tt&gt; as all the
documentation would have it--you need to run
&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;python &lt;span class="pre"&gt;-m&lt;/span&gt; celery.bin.celeryd&lt;/tt&gt; in Windows. Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seriously, don't write Python code on Windows--if you can avoid it. I'm
considering installing VirtualBox on the machines on which I have to run
Windows just to avoid having to deal with these headaches.&lt;/p&gt;

Depending on what I am
watching, I sometimes want to manually tweak the quality of the
streaming beyond Netflix's automatic detection--for example, some videos
playing in full HD overwhelm the machine's ability to decode the video,
causing stuttering. Alternatively, I may want to force HD for some
videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a built-in but not easy to find way to do this. While watching
the video (not fullscreen), press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+s. This will bring up
an option to manually set the bitrate. Note that doing this will turn
off Netflix's automatic detection for the current video, so for example
if your network connection slows down, you may see stuttering and/or
buffering.&lt;/p&gt;

PC build. When I went to install Ubuntu on it, my network connection was
horribly slow--time outs all over the place, slow downloads, and even
slow transfer speeds on the local network. A bit of research showed a
mind boggling amount of dropped packets as well. As it turns out, this
motherboard (and presumably other motherboards of the GA-Z68 series)
have a Realtek 8111E ethernet chipset, which has some known issues in
Ubuntu--namely that Ubuntu loads a slightly wrong driver for it. The
driver works, sort of, but people see lots of issues like mine--dropped
packets, slow speeds, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the fix is fairly easy. Realtek has the &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.realtek.com/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;amp;PNid=13&amp;amp;PFid=5&amp;amp;Level=5&amp;amp;Conn=4&amp;amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;amp;GetDown=false"&gt;proper Linux driver
available&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it says it is for kernels 2.4.x and 2.6.x, I
can confirm that it does indeed work in the 3.0.x kernels present in
Ubuntu 11.10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some great instructions over at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foxhop.net/realtek-dropping-packets-on-linux-ubuntu-and-fedora"&gt;Foxhop.net&lt;/a&gt;. Note that the
first step will be making sure that you have your kernel headers and
build-essential packages installed! After installing the proper driver,
everything is working just like it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Get the updated driver:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;wget &lt;span class="pre"&gt;http://www.foxhop.net/attachment/r8168-8.023.00.tar.bz2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Remove the offending kernel module:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo rmmod r8169&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;dl class="first docutils"&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Install the new driver:&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p class="first last"&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;cd &lt;span class="pre"&gt;r8168-8.023.00&lt;/span&gt; sudo ./autorun.sh&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

a Vent server and play a few games once a week as a good way to stay in
touch. One of the games is Battlefield 3. I am in the middle of slowly
building a new machine, purchasing parts as they go on sale, and as part
of that, ended up with an SSD. I figured I'd go ahead and throw the SSD
in my old machine and move my games onto it to take advantage of it
until I finished the rest of the new machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Battlefield 3 requires Origin, EA's terrible ripoff of
Steam, which seems to add no value to the experience and as far as I can
tell, does nothing but annoy anyone. One sign of its immaturity is that
it doesn't easily support moving game installation directories like
Steam does. However, I really didn't want to re-download all 10GB of
Battlefield 3, so I did some digging to see what I could do. Buried deep
in the EA forums, I found out how to move an install. It involves a
registry edit, so make sure you are comfortable with regedit, and/or
take a backup before doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the install directory to the new location. I used a copy manager
(TeraCopy) to do this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run regedit.exe.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\EA
Games\Battlefield 3] in the registry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the GDFBinary key to reflect the new location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Change the Install Dir key to reflect the new location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Navigate to [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Electronic
Arts\Battlefield 3] and update the directories in this
location--needed to ensure the uninstall functionality works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update your desktop and/or start menu shortcuts to reflect the new
location.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Way more work than it should be, but there it is. Hopefully EA will get
it together at some point, but I'm less than optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As another note, Origin uses a browser-based server browser. While this
isn't the worst thing in the world, it does mean you have to restart the
game every time you change servers. As such, the game really benefits
from an SSD--my time from clicking &amp;quot;Join&amp;quot; to being in-game went from 3+
minutes to about 30 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;

All of my personal machines run it, and I rarely use
anything else except at work. However, some decisions in the most recent
release, 11.10, remove some basic configurability options that annoy me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of these is the ability to change the system font sizes. I don't
want my windows to have giant size 16 titles--it's a waste of space, and
while big fonts are all the rage, I don't want them wasting my valuable
desktop real estate. However, there is no way to change this out of the
box--an annoying oversight in my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Luckily it's easy to fix with an additional configuration tool:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;sudo &lt;span class="pre"&gt;apt-get&lt;/span&gt; install &lt;span class="pre"&gt;gnome-tweak-tool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

under &amp;quot;Advanced Settings&amp;quot; in your menu) and changing the requisite
options under &amp;quot;Fonts.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

basic, but there it is.&lt;/p&gt;

on clients' machines. As part of my most recent engagement, I've done a
bit of quick Python scripting to take care of some straightforward
tasks. I initially installed my default VIM setup on this machine, but
have run into some issues with it that I haven't experienced elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest is an overall slowness when opening, closing, saving,
or even editing files. Sometimes it would take up to ten seconds to
enter insert mode--totally unacceptable, and strange for an editor like
VIM that was originally built to work over paltry network connections
20+ years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, like many corporate environments, very little is
actually stored on the local machine. Almost every location that a user
has write access to is a network drive that has been mapped to a drive
letter. Also like many corporate networks and SAN setups, this one was
overtaxed and slow. This, combined with one of the plugins I was using,
the otherwise excellent minibufexpl, turned out to be causing the bulk
of my issues, which I discovered after deactivating all of my plugins
and reactivating them one by one. It seems that minibufexpl was
traversing all of the open buffers every time a user performed an
action. I found some chatter about this, and some proposed patches, but
even after updating to the most recent version, the issue persisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to solve it, I unfortunately had to move away from minibufexpl
for this machine, and replace it with BufExplorer. BufExplorer is not
ideal for me--I can see how it would be helpful for editing dozens of
files at once, but I rarely have more than ten or so open at a time, so
minibufexpl's visual buffer representation is much better for me.
However, this new setup does fix my issues and after remapping some keys
in my vimrc--primarily binding &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&amp;lt;leader&amp;gt;b&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;:BufExplorer&lt;/tt&gt;, it's
almost as nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, minibufexpl will fix this at some point in the future. Until
then, its BufExplorer for me.&lt;/p&gt;
