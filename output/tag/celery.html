                				<div class="entry-content"> <p>Seriously, just don't.</p>
<p>I love Python. I got my start writing it at work to automate simple but
tedious tasks (&quot;rename these 4,000 files according to their author and
timestamp&quot;), but quickly started tinkering with it for all sorts of
other uses. One of the things I love about it most is that it is
(usually) clean, clear, and concise. You know exactly what the code is
doing.</p>
<p>However, writing Python code in Windows is a colossal PITA. Whereas in
Linux (and presumably Mac) the Python binaries and libraries are a
simple package manager call away, in Windows, there is no shortage of
the hoops you have to jump through.</p>
<p>Most recently, I was trying to install the most recent version of Celery
on Windows 7 using pip. This however failed with cryptic
<tt class="docutils literal">Unable to find vcvarsall.bat</tt> errors.</p>
<p>Turns out, this was related to the Python distutils being unable to find
a compiler. To resolve this, do the following:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Download and install the MinGW compiler from&nbsp;<a class="reference external" href="http://www.mingw.org/">http://www.mingw.org/</a>.
Make sure to select the c and c++ compilers when installing.</li>
<li>Add&nbsp;C:\MinGW\bin (or wherever you installed MinGW) to the system
path.</li>
<li>Open (create if it doesn't exist) the
file&nbsp;PYTHONPATH\Lib\distutils\distutils.cfg (for me, this was
in&nbsp;C:\Python27\Lib\distutils).</li>
<li>Add the below lines to the file:</li>
</ol>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">[build]</tt></p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">compiler=mingw32</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>This resolved the first error. However, that didn't fix everything--now
I was getting
<tt class="docutils literal">gcc: error: unrecognized command line option <span class="pre">'-mno-cygwin'</span></tt> errors.
Turns out that this is related to a deprecated gcc flag that the version
of distutils included in my version of Python (2.7.2) was using.</p>
<p>To fix this, I went into C:\Python27\Lib\distutils\distutils.py and
found all places where it was calling gcc with this deprecated flag.
There was a cluster of them around line 322. I then removed the
-mno-cygwin flag from these gcc calls.</p>
<p>After this, everything installed successfully. What a pain.</p>
<p>Oh, and once it's running, you can't run <tt class="docutils literal">celeryd</tt> as all the
documentation would have it--you need to run
<tt class="docutils literal">python <span class="pre">-m</span> celery.bin.celeryd</tt> in Windows. Sigh.</p>
<p>Seriously, don't write Python code on Windows--if you can avoid it. I'm
considering installing VirtualBox on the machines on which I have to run
Windows just to avoid having to deal with these headaches.</p>
